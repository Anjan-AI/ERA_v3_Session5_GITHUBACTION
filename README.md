## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch (CPU or GPU version)
- torchvision
- pytest

## Installation

### For GPU Development
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
### For CPU-Only Development or CI/CD
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt
pip install -e .
```
## Local Testing
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
python src/train.py
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Sets up a Python environment
2. Installs CPU-only dependencies
3. Runs all tests
4. Trains the model
5. Saves the trained model as an artifact

## Model Details
- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Parameters: <25,000
- Input shape: 28x28 grayscale images
- Output: 10 classes (digits 0-9)
- Target accuracy: >95% training accuracy in 1 epoch

## Model Artifacts
Models are automatically saved with the following naming convention:
`mnist_model_<accuracy>acc_<timestamp>.pth`


## GitHub Actions
The pipeline runs automatically on every push to the repository:
- Uses CPU-only PyTorch version
- Executes all tests
- Trains model
- Stores model artifacts
- Results viewable in Actions tab

## Development Notes
- Local development supports both CPU and GPU
- CI/CD pipeline runs on CPU only
- All tests must pass for successful deployment
- Model artifacts are retained for 90 days


## Notes
- The model is trained on CPU in GitHub Actions
- Trained models are saved as artifacts in the workflow
- All tests must pass for successful deployment


## To use this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Push your changes to the new branch
4. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch
5. The workflow will automatically run and deploy your changes if all tests pass
